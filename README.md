## Running the Program with gradle

The program should be run using gradle.

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/BeefyMcGee/FreeFlow.git
    cd FreeFlow
    ```

2. Run the project using Gradle:
    ```bash
    ./gradlew run
    ```
The main file is src/main/java/App.java. By default, this file is set to use the GUI implementation, but you can toggle this by commenting out that part of main() and uncommenting the algorithm tester code snippet.
